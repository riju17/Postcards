        <p>About the Bird</p>

        <p>Hummingbirds are among the most extraordinary wonders of the avian world — miniature, dazzling creatures capable of feats that defy the limits of nature. With over 360 species, they are the smallest warm-blooded vertebrates on Earth, yet possess one of the most powerful wing mechanisms ever evolved. Their wings beat up to 80 times per second, and during courtship dives, some species even cross 200 beats per second, producing the signature humming sound from which they get their name.</p>
        <p>Their flight is powered by a unique ball-and-socket shoulder joint, allowing the wing to rotate a full 180°, enabling them to hover in place like aircraft, fly backward, sideways, and even upside down. This maneuverability, combined with their rapid wingbeats, makes them the only birds capable of true hovering flight.</p>
        <p>Hummingbirds display brilliant iridescence, produced not by pigments but by microscopic platelets in their feathers that refract and bend light — giving them shimmering colors that change with angle and sunlight, much like a prism or gemstone.</p>
        <p>Metabolically, hummingbirds are marvels of efficiency and speed. They have the highest metabolic rate of any bird species, requiring them to feed every 10–15 minutes. To survive, they visit 1,500–2,000 flowers a day, consuming nectar for energy and small insects and spiders for protein. At night or during bad weather, they enter torpor, a hibernation-like state where heart rate and body temperature drop dramatically, helping conserve energy.</p>
        <p>Ecologically, hummingbirds are key pollinators of countless flowering plants, especially those with tubular blooms designed specifically for their long, narrow bills. Many plant species have evolved in direct partnership with them, creating one of nature’s most beautiful examples of co-evolution.</p>
        <p>Despite their delicate appearance, hummingbirds are fiercely territorial, often defending feeding territories with remarkable courage and aerial agility. Their presence enriches ecosystems, supporting plant reproduction, forest diversity, and the overall health of the environments they inhabit.</p>
        <p>In every sense — biological, ecological, and aesthetic — hummingbirds are true jewels of nature: symbols of beauty, resilience, and the intricate wonders of evolution. Placeholder blog-style narrative covering nectar foraging, pollination, and the postcard story.</p>
