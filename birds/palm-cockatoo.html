        <h2>About this Bird</h2>
        <p>About the Card: Left Czech Republic on 2nd May 2024; Arrived India on 21st May 2025. ZOO Praha; 100th anniversary of Czech Astronomical Society; 2021 Census</p>
        <p>About the Bird</p>
        <p>The Palm Cockatoo, also known as the Goliath Cockatoo, is one of the most charismatic parrots of the Australasian rainforests. Standing nearly 60 cm tall with a sweeping crest, glossy charcoal plumage, and expressive red facial patches, it commands attention wherever it is seen.</p>
        <p>Males are famous for their rhythmic drumming rituals. They snap twigs into “drumsticks,” then beat on hollow trunks with unique patterns to impress potential mates. Few animals beyond humans create such structured beats, making the Palm Cockatoo a celebrated example of avian creativity.</p>
        <p>Its massive, curved bill allows the bird to crack the toughest rainforest nuts—Pandanus, Canarium, and other seeds that many species cannot access. By dispersing these seeds, Palm Cockatoos help regenerate their ancestral forests.</p>
        <p>Despite their formidable presence, Palm Cockatoos reproduce slowly. A pair may raise only a single chick every one or two years, and the young take months to fledge. This slow life cycle leaves the species vulnerable to habitat loss and nest tree shortages.</p>
        <p>Today, the Palm Cockatoo is listed as Near Threatened, with fewer than 50,000 birds estimated in the wild. Protecting old-growth forests and the hollow-bearing trees they depend upon remains central to their conservation.</p>
        <p>With haunting calls, intelligent eyes, and iconic drumming, the Palm Cockatoo remains an unforgettable ambassador for the rainforests of New Guinea, Cape York, and nearby islands—an enduring favorite in postcard collections around the world.</p>
